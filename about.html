                        <h2>Some kind of bio goes here</h2>
                        <p>28 year old graphic designer based in Oeiras, currently working as a UI Designer at Fullsix,
                            one of the biggest creative agencies in Portugal. Always having great curiosity regarding
                            the artistic world, Rafaela always knew she would be somewhere in between.<br><br> With a
                            degree in Multimedia Art at the Faculty of Fine Arts of Lisbon, she then did a one year
                            course in Graphic Design at Restart Instituto de Artes e Criatividade, before jumping into
                            her Master's Degree in Graphic Design and Editorial Projects at the Faculty of Fine Arts, in
                            Porto.<br> She started working part-time while studying, at a Photography Studio doing
                            post-production and photo retouching, skills that were most valuable when she started her
                            internship for her Master's Degree, in Col√∂nia Design Studio, in Porto. Having the
                            opportunity to work as a graphic designer and photography assistant while studing in another
                            city was a great way for her to grow as an artist as well as a person.<br><br> After
                            finishing her studies, Rafaela worked for a year and a half in a wine company, Darwin Bev,
                            as a graphic designer and creative strategist, acquiring good skills in label design and
                            packaging. Nowadays, she still works as a freelancer for Quevedo Port Wine.<br> Having a
                            background mostly in the offline world, she is now having the opportunity to be a part of
                            the UI Design team at Fullsix, another area that always had her interest. If you want to
                            know a bit more about her or have any questions, feel free to send an <a
